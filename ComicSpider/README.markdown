A personal tool. Now it was just a prototype for future. My Guide Recognition arithmetic will be use to make it fit most sites automatically in future. For testing, now I manually parsed the site http://www.mangahere.com/ via regular expression.

Maybe use mono will make the project open, but now windows only.

Techniques are required:

* C#, .NET3.5, WPF
* SQLite
* Html5, css3, js, jQuery
* Python
